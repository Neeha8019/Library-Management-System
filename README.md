# 📚 Library Management System

A simple Java-based console application that simulates a basic library system. It allows librarians to manage books and members, and enables members to borrow and return books.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This system demonstrates core Java principles like object-oriented programming, class relationships, and data handling without a database.

### 🔍 Key Features

- Add and manage books
- Register library members
- Borrow and return books
- View available and borrowed books
